Currently, you need to download the source code:

In the terminal, first set up dependencies. Make sure you are in the right directory: 
  `Run npm install`
  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After this, open up two Terminals.
In one terminal:
run  `python data.py` 

After that, in other terminal:
run `cd exosky-app
npm start`
